## 📋 Priority Order (Suggested)

1. **Admin Announcements** — easiest, biggest impact
2. **Signatures** — tiny feature, big personality
3. **User Homepage** — the big one, enables many sub-features
4. **Random World Events** — makes the feed come alive
5. **Achievement Badges** — gamification keeps people engaged
6. Everything else as inspiration strikes! ✨
